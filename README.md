# FriendsMapBackend
Backend for a school project called Friends map.

# Setup and run
Before running the application, please create a MySQL schema from the scripts found in the SQL folder. After this modify the application.properties file with the correct Mysql information to make sure the database connection can be made.

# Android app info(Release 1):
Please use username teemu because there is currently no possibility to register :D. Also, the android application
is trying to make the api calls to http://localhost:8080/ so make sure you run the backend on localhost for now..
